      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <img src="plato.jpeg" alt="Plato" class="plato-image">
      <p>Born around 427 BCE in Athens, Greece, Plato was one of the most important and enduring philosophers of the ancient world. His father, Ariston, was descended from Athenian nobility, while his mother, Perictione, came from a prominent and wealthy family. This aristocratic background undoubtedly influenced Plato's views on the role of the philosophers and the nature of the ideal society.</p>

                <p>From an early age, Plato showed a deep interest in philosophy and the pursuit of knowledge. He was a pupil of the great philosopher Socrates, who had a profound impact on Plato's thinking. Socrates' method of questioning and exploring fundamental ideas was an important part of Plato's education and would later become a cornerstone of his own philosophical method.</p>

                <p>After Socrates' execution in 399 BCE, Plato traveled around the Mediterranean, absorbing the teachings of other philosophers as well as engaging in political activities. In 387 BCE, he returned to Athens and founded the Academy, an institution dedicated to the study of philosophy, mathematics, and science. The Academy would become a center of learning that attracted some of the greatest philosophers and thinkers of the ancient world, including Aristotle, who would later become one of Plato's most famous pupils.</p>

                <p>It was at the Academy that Plato wrote most of his philosophical works, which he composed in the form of dialogues. These dialogues explored a wide range of topics, including ethics, justice, and the nature of reality. Many of them feature Socrates as the main character, serving as a mouthpiece for Plato's ideas. Some of the most famous dialogues include The Republic, an exploration of the ideal society, and The Symposium, a meditation on love and desire.</p>

                <p>Plato continued to lead the Academy and write dialogues until his death in 347 BCE. His influence on Western philosophy cannot be overstated. The works of Plato have been studied and analyzed for millennia, and his ideas on metaphysics, ethics, and the nature of reality continue to be debated by philosophers today.</p>
